Here is an article that I found [interesting] (https://cxotoday.com/interviews/generative-ais-role-in-revolutionizing-software-development-shaping-the-future-of-engineering-skills-and-inclusivity/)

I found this article interesting because it talks about generative AI's role is shaping the future of software engineering. There is a misconception that generative AI will replace software engineers. But in reality, generative AI will become a tool to help the day-to-day tasks of software engineering. While software engineers will still be required to poesses knowledge of relevant technologies such as Java, SQL, etc., engineers will start to be expected to know how to use AI within the workflow. Some important skills related to AI will be communication (so you can use the right prompts for AI) and problem-solving skills.

The article also mentions the progress in women's representation in engineering. The concentration of women in AI engineering is increasing, with lots of more work to do to boost representation in engineering. The article suggests that women can get better involved in tech through mentors, resource groups, and networking.
